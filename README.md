### Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. API, or application-programming interface, allow third party entities to access another website's information. Many encourage this openness and sharing of data, as it fosters an intertwined network of users and their corresponding actions. 
2. AJAX, asynchronous JavaScript and XML, allows u8sers to load date from a server without a browser page refresh. These applications are data-driven instead of page-driven. With the help of others, like HTML, CSS and JavaScript, AJAX can create faster and more interactive apps. 
3. JSON, JavaScript Object Notation and XML, is an extension of JavaScript scripting language. APIs can use JSON format to provide public data. Additionally, lightweight text-based open standard is useful to transmit data between a server and web applications.
